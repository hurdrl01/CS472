Project 4:
-50 The ratio for ticks-used is not close enough to the ratio of tickets
$ spin 6 100000000 &;spin 3 100000000 &
$ tickets: 1 	 pid: 6 	 ticks-used: 1
tickets: 1 	 pid: 5 	 ticks-used: 6
tickets: 1 	 pid: 6 	 ticks-used: 2
tickets: 6 	 pid: 5 	 ticks-used: 21
tickets: 3 	 pid: 6 	 ticks-used: 422
tickets: 6 	 pid: 5 	 ticks-used: 953
zombie!
tickets: 3 	 pid: 6 	 ticks-used: 938
zombie!

the ratio for 3 6 should be 1:2, the ratio for ticks-used is 2.258
